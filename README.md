# ðŸ’» Laptop Price Predictor

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the price of a laptop based on its features such as RAM, CPU, GPU, brand, screen resolution, and more.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset includes specifications of various laptops along with their prices. Key features include:
- Brand
- Processor (CPU)
- RAM
- Storage (HDD, SSD)
- GPU
- Screen Size & Resolution
- Operating System
- Touchscreen and IPS display info

## ðŸ§  Model Development
The project follows standard ML pipeline steps:
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
3. **Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding**
4. **Model Training** using `Random Forest`, `Linear Regression`, and `XGBoost`
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning** for best performance

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
Achieved good prediction accuracy using ensemble models with appropriate feature engineering and tuning.
